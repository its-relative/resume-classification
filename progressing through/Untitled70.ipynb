      "Description: Traffic congestion is a severe problem in most of the cities across the world and it has become a nightmare for the citizens. It is caused by delay in signal, inappropriate timing of traffic signalling etc. The delay of traffic light is hard coded and it does not depend on traffic. Therefore, for optimising traffic control, there is an increasing demand in systematic quick automatic system. This project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal control. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. The microcontroller used in this project is ARDUINO. The system contains IR sensors & ultrasonic sensors (transmitter and receiver) which will be mounted on the either side of the road on poles. It gets activated and receives the signal as the vehicles passes close by it.\n",

It is an online Directory Service for identifying Places important to you (such as your home, oﬃce, business, etc.),   which is designed for mobile use and optimized to take advantage of the capabilities of smart phones. My Map Tags hold much more information about a Place than just the address. They include things like photos, special instructions, directional helps (such as landmarks and route guide lines), contact details, descriptive information, and of course the GPS coordinates that show you the exact location on a map. The Tags are private and secure and controlled by the Map Tag owner. Individual Map Tags are not accessible to anyone, unless authorized by owner.\n",
