# Resume Classification Project

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to classify resumes into different categories based on their content.

## Features

* Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization
* Feature extraction: Using TF-IDF vectors as input features
* Model training: Training multiple machine learning models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Bagging, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Naive Bayes) on the preprocessed data
* Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Models

* KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* SVM (Support Vector Machine)
* Logistic Regression
* Bagging
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting
* Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Vectorizers

* TF-IDF vectorizer and Word2Vec for each model

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
